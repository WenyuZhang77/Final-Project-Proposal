### The tentative project title

Risky NY

### The motivation for this project

In the 1980s, New York was one of the most crime-ridden cities in the
United States. From the 1990s to the 2010s, the crime rate of NYC
dropped sharply. Nowadays, NYC has become one of the lowest crime rates
of major cities in the US.

### The intended final products

### The anticipated data sources

The data was collected from NYC open data, which is about NYPD Complaint
Data Historic. This dataset includes all valid felony, misdemeanor, and
violation crimes reported to the New York City Police Department (NYPD)
from 2006 to the end of last year (2019). The data was collected
annually. The dataset has 7.38M rows and 35 variables, each row is a
complaint.

### The planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges

Firstly, the analyses would be performed on the crime distribution of
the district, and an interactive map would be generated. Then the
analysis of information (age, gender, race) of the victim would also be
performed, and the bar chart would also be used to visualize the result.
Furthermore, linear regression would be performed, and it would be used
to predict the crime rate for each distribution in the next couple of
years. Since the dataset has 7,375,993 datas, it is challenging to tidy
such a large dataset.
